# ADOPTERS

This document contains a non-exhaustive list of organizations that adopted
Kubewarden. Feel free to add your organization to the list, with a link to your
organization website.

Assessing the kind of organizations who adopt Kubewarden is important to us.
First to our community, as it helps them to understand how similar organization
benefits from the project.
But also for the project itself. It allows us to better understand how
Kubewarden is being used which help us to influence its direction in the best
way.

Being a CNCF project, Kubewarden requires a list of independent adopters to
grow into the next stage. Sharing that you are using Kubewarden in production
is one of the most meaningful contributions you can do.
