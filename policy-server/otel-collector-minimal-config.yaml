# This is the minimal configuration to start a OpenTelemetry collector
# that collects traces via the otlp protocol, and then sends them via
# batches to a central jaeger collector
#
# A simple otel-collector instance can be started in this way:
#
#   docker run --rm -p 4317:4317 \
#     -v `pwd`/otel-collector-minimal-config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml:ro \
#     otel/opentelemetry-collector-dev:latest
